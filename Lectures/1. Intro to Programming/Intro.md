# Introduction to Programming

## What is a programming language

- A programming language is a formal system for writing instructions for a computer to execute.

- A programming language is a set of instructions for a computer to follow.
- Computer at very low level only understand Zeros and Ones.

-  Language is a mode of communication, similarly programming language is a way to communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task. Each programming language contains a unique set of keywords and syntax, which are used to create a set of instructions.

## Types Of Programming Language:-
- 	Low-level language
- 	High-level language
- 	Assembly Language (middle level language)
### 1. Low-level programming language
 - Low-level language is machine-dependent (0s and 1s) programming language. The processor runs low- level programs directly without the need of a compiler or interpreter, so the programs written in low-level language can be run very fast. 
- Low-level language is further divided into two parts -
i. Machine Language
ii. Assembly Language
- There are some differences between machine and assembly language-

### 2. High-level programming language
High-level programming language (HLL) is designed for developing user-friendly software programs and websites. This programming language requires a compiler or interpreter to translate the program into machine language (execute the program).
- The main advantage of a high-level language is that it is easy to read, write, and maintain. High-level programming language includes Python, Java, JavaScript, PHP, C#, C++, Objective C, Cobol, Perl, Pascal, LISP, FORTRAN, and Swift programming language.
- A high-level language is further divided into two parts -
i. Procedural Oriented programming language
Example: C, FORTRAN, Basic, Pascal, etc.
ii. Object-Oriented Programming language
Example: C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.

## Most Popular Programming Languages 

## 1. Python
    
Python is one of the most widely used user-friendly programming languages. It is an open-source and easy to learn programming language developed in the 1990s. It is mostly used in Machine learning, Artificial intelligence, Big Data, GUI based desktop applications, and Robotics.
Other areas of implementation include backend and full stack development, data reprocessing and improvement of cybersecurity features. In addition, Python can be used to automate repetitive tasks and carry out tests.

## 2. Javascript
  
JavaScript is a type of scripting language that is used on both client-side as well as a server-side. It is developed in the 1990s for the Netscape Navigator web browser. It allows programmers to implement complex features to make web pages alive. It helps programmers to create dynamic websites, servers, mobile applications, animated graphics, games, and more.


## 3. C/C++/C#
   
C is a popular, simple, and flexible general-purpose computer programming language. Dennis M Ritchie develops it in 1972 at AT&T.
C++ is one of the thousands of programming languages that we use to develop software. C++ programming language is developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1980. It is similar to the C programming language but also includes some additional features such as exception handling, object-oriented programming, type checking, etc
C# (pronounced as C sharp) is a modern, general-purpose, and object-oriented programming language used with XML based Web services on the .NET platform. It is mainly designed to improve productivity in web applications. It is easier to learn for those users who have sufficient knowledge of common programming languages like C, C++.

## 4. PHP
 
PHP is an open-source multi-purpose utilitarian language used to create web apps. With rich extendable features and a supportive user community, it has established itself as a top pick for both novice and seasoned programmers. Thanks to high resourcefulness, its code can be readjusted with no additional costs.

## 5.  Java
 
Java is a simple, secure, platform-independent, reliable, architecture-neutral high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Now, Java is owned by Oracle. It is mainly used to develop bank, retail, information technology, android, big data, research community, web, and desktop applications.
Flowchart in Programming
Flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing.
There are several symbols which are used in flowcharts -
Symbols Used In Flowchart
Symbol	Purpose	Description
 	Flow line	Indicates the flow of logic by connecting symbols.
 	Terminal(Stop/Start)	Represents the start and the end of a flowchart.
 	Input/Output	Used for input and output operation.
 	Processing	Used for arithmetic operations and data-manipulations.
 	Decision	Used for decision making between two or more alternatives.
 	On-page Connector	Used to join different flowline
 	Off-page Connector	Used to connect the flowchart portion on a different page.
 	Predefined Process/Function	Represents a group of statements performing one processing task.

## Advantages of Flowchart:
1. Flowcharts are better way of communicating the logic of system.
2. Flowcharts act as a guide for blueprint during program designed.
3. Flowcharts helps in debugging process.
4. With the help of flowcharts programs can be easily analyzed.
5. It provides better documentation.
6. Flowcharts serve as a good proper documentation.
Disadvantages of Flowchart:
1. It is difficult to draw flowchart for large and complex programs.
2. In this their is no standard to determine the amount of detail.
3. Difficult to reproduce the flowcharts.
4. It is very difficult to modify the Flowchart.
Example : Draw a flowchart to input two numbers from user and display the largest of two numbers
 
# What is Pseudocode?

- Pseudocode is a way of expressing an algorithm without conforming to specific syntax rules. By learning to read and write pseudocode, you can easily communicate ideas and concepts to other programmers, even though they may be using completely different languages. It has no syntax like any of the programming language and thus can’t be compiled or interpreted by the computer.

## Advantages of Pseudocode

•	Improves the readability of any approach. It’s one of the best approaches to start implementation of an algorithm.

•	Acts as a bridge between the program and the algorithm or flowchart. Also works as a rough documentation, so the program of one developer can be understood easily when a pseudo code is written out. In industries, the approach of documentation is essential. And that’s where a pseudo-code proves vital.

•	The main goal of a pseudo code is to explain what exactly each line of a program should do, hence making the code construction phase easier for the programmer.

### The main constructs of pseudocode

- The core of pseudocode is the ability to represent 6 programming constructs. SEQUENCE, CASE, WHILE, REPEAT-UNTIL, FOR, and IF-THEN-ELSE. These constructs — also called keywords —are used to describe the control flow of the algorithm.

	1.	SEQUENCE represents linear tasks sequentially performed one after the other.

	2.	WHILE a loop with a condition at its beginning.

	3.	REPEAT-UNTIL a loop with a condition at the bottom.
	4.	FOR another way of looping.

	5.	IF-THEN-ELSE a conditional statement changing the flow of the algorithm.

	6.	CASE the generalization form of IF-THEN-ELSE.

EXAMPLE:-

``Add Two Numbers Program Pseudocode Algorithm:``

``PSEUDOCODE``

    Start
    Declare Integer a, b, sum
    Output "Sum of Two Numbers"
    Input a
    Input b
    Assign sum = a+b
    Output "The total sum of " & a & " and " & b & " is " & sum &"." 
    Stop
``ALGORITHM``

	Step 1: Start
	Step 2: Declare variables A,B,SUM
	Step 3: Input two numbers say A and B
	Step 4: SUM = A + B
	Step 5: Display SUM
	Step 6: Stop
